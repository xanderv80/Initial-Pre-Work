/*  It's simple things like this that I gloss over because I don't think there is any practical use for knowing the 3rd character in a string, yet later I get stuck solving problems because I forget you can do this type of stuff*/

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
