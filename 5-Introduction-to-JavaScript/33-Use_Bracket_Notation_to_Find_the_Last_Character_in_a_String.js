/* So clever, I don't know why code like this makes me smile. I love building on logic of more basic fundamental concepts such as string.length  */

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 1];
