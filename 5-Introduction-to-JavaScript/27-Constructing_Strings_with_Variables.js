/* Its things like this that makes backend seem more fun than frontend. I really like putting things like this together and make things.  */

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Alex";
var myStr ="My name is " + myName + " and I am well!";
