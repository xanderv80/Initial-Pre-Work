/* This seems simple but later I was surprise to see this used for varification in later Objects. I had a hard time actually using this in practice. Side note: Ada Lovelace is another favorite historal figure.  */

// Example
var firstNameLength = 0;
var firstName = "Ada";

firstNameLength = firstName.length;

// Setup
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName;

lastNameLength = lastName.length;
