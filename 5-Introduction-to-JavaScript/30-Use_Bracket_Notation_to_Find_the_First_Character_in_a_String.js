/* It has been awhile since I've coded in javascript, treating strings like arrays is another thing I had forgotten  */

// Example
var firstLetterOfFirstName = "";
var firstName = "Ada";

firstLetterOfFirstName = firstName[0];

// Setup
var firstLetterOfLastName = "";
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
firstLetterOfLastName = lastName;

firstLetterOfLastName = lastName[0];
