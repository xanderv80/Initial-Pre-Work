/* I way overthought this problem at first. I was going to do something weird like adding and subtracting values using the values of other variables. */

// Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
