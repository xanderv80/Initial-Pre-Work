/* There is a side project that I'm working on where this function might be a better solution than I was initialy thinking about. There is still so much that I need to learn... */

// Example
var ourArray = [1,2,3];
var removedFromOurArray = ourArray.pop(); 
// removedFromOurArray now equals 3, and ourArray now equals [1,2]

// Setup
var myArray = [["John", 23], ["cat", 2]];

// Only change code below this line.
var removedFromMyArray = myArray.pop();
