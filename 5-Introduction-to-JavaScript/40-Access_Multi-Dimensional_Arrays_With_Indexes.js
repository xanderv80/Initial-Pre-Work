/* This is where things slow start getting complicated. Although this lesson wasn't hard, at some point I lose the thread of logic with more complex arrays */

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
