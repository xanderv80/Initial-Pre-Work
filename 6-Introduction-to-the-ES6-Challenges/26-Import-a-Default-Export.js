/* Finally the end of the prework. This was much harder than I thought it would be. I really made me question if I'm up to the challenge. I love to code, I really do, but I've only ever done so in my spare time and personal projects. I have been trying to be software developer for 4 years now and feel like I'm ready enough to at least pull my own weight in a team. I promise if Techtonic gives me a chance that I will devote my whole life in being an asset instead of a libility. I have a few small programs that I've made that are in my Github account, you can see there how long I've been fiddling with code and hopefully see that I'm a bit above a complete noob */
